<h1>Aces and Kings</h1>
<p>
Two-Deck game type. 2 decks. No redeal.

<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
Move all the cards to the foundations.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
The four leftmost foundations are built up from ace to king,
while the four foundations on the right are built down from
king to ace.
<p>
There are two thirteen card reserves, along with four talon piles.
The topmost card of the reserve may be moved to any appropriate
foundation, as may any of the talon cards.  No building is allowed
on the talon, and if a talon card is moved, it is replaced from
the top of the stock.
<p>
Cards are dealt from the stock one at a time.  No redeal is allowed.
When the stock is empty, any card can be moved to an empty tableau
pile.

<h3>Strategy</h3>
Note that you are allowed to move cards from one foundation to
another.  In fact, it's pretty much necessary to win.
