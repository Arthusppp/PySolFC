<h1>Assist Options</h1>
<p>
PySolFC contains a number of assist options to make winning games easier.
Note that if you manage to win a game without using assist options, the game
will be credited as a perfect game in the statistics (though there are a few
assist options that can be used freely without penalties, as seen below).
Though some games have additional requirements to be credited as a perfect
game.
<p>
Below are the assist options PySol offers:

<h2>Undo/Redo</h2>
<p>
PySol allows you to undo/redo an infinite number of moves per game.  If you undo
all moves, the game will not score in the statistics.

<h2>Bookmarks</h2>
<p>
During each game, you can set up to nine bookmarks.  After setting each bookmark,
you can return to each of them, restoring the game to the state it was in when the
bookmark was set.  Bookmarks are saved for each game, and reset when you start a
new game.

<h2>Shuffle Tiles</h2>
<p>
In Mahjongg games, you can use the shuffle tiles option to reshuffle all of the
remaining tiles and redeal the remaining parts of the layout.

<h2>Hint</h2>
<p>
Hint points out a recommended move that you can make (or at least one possible
valid move - the intelligence of the hints can vary from game to game).
<p>
If you use a hint, the game will be marked as a loss if completed.  However,
if you enable the "Free Hints" option, the game will be marked as a win, just not
a perfect game.

<h2>Auto Drop</h2>
<p>
Auto drop will automatically move all cards that can be moved to foundations
to the foundations.  It can also be enabled in the options menu to auto drop
all the time without needing to select the option.
<p>
Auto drop is disabled for certain games where it is not relevant, or if it
would make winning the game too much of a cheat.  Using auto drop does not
disqualify you from getting a perfect game.

<h2>Highlight Piles</h2>
<p>
Highlight piles highlights any sequences of cards in the tableau that can be
moved as a unit.  Using this does not disqualify you from getting a perfect game.

<h2>Find Card</h2>
<p>
The find card feature will locate and highlight any face-up instances of the chosen
card.  Using this does not disqualify you from getting a perfect game.
